This is the server-side CGI program to react on requests by the PGPAuth app (http://github.com/LittleFox94/PGPAuth).
Please report bugs here:
https://github.com/LittleFox94/PGPAuth/issues


Compile-time-requirements:
 - Gnu CGICC
 - GPGME

Runtime-requirements:
 - CGI-capable HTTP-server
 - PGPAuth App (see link provided up there)

Known bugs:
 - only the first signature is checked


INSTALL:

 - set PGP homedir and the maximum timestamp difference in pgpauth.h.
 - define the actions to be done on open/close in pgpauth.cpp (open() and close()).
 - compile with:
   g++ main.cpp pgpauth.cpp -o pgpauth_cgi -lcgicc -lgpgme
 - create PGP homedir and give your webserver-account the only access rights (GnuPG checks them)
 - su to webserver-account and fetch/import the keys allowed to do requests (don't forget --homedir)
 - trust the keys allowed to do requests (don't forget --homedir)
 - move pgpauth_cgi binary to CGI-location of your webserver
 - configure PGPAuth app to point to that executable
 - enjoy :)
